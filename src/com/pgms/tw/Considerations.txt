Please feel free to capture any design considerations you'd like us to note,
along with any edge-cases that you identified but did not handle here.



-read from file, once

Edge cases not handled:
-If dataTypes not matched
- If file content chnaged

-If the DataType of the value is different from the requested type

-results of  get*List methods can be cached to improve performance
Read once, group by override,



if number of override is less{
    -duplicate override data
    - retreval is fast
}
else{
    -dont duplicate
    -retreval is heavy

}
